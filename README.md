# BOTS

Bots here are scripts that automate various random tasks so that you don't have to do them manually. Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive. This repository contains minions created by myself to help me out with various stuff. All of them have names and they are to be treated like pals.

Vision for this repository is : eventually when bot population crosses some number, I'll create a bot town where these bots will interact and develop on their own and use each other's services. That said, I have no clue what categories of bots and scripts I'll be building. This endeavor is going to have a long lifespan.
